#### _Udacity FEND final project - Neighborhood Map_

## Project Overview:

For the **Neighborhood Map** projects, I bootstrapped the project with the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In which I created some react components and add a Google Map to the project using [google-maps-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-maps-react) and list to display my locations using [@material-ui/core](https://material-ui.com/) a React components that implement Google's Material Design. I also enable the react default service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Specification

I was provided with the a project specification rubrics for the Neighborhood Map to be designed in React.  My job was to develop a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood or a neighborhood I would like to visit. In which I was required to add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

### What do you do from here?

1. In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

2. Click on any marker to display that locations.

3. Click on the Hamburger Icon to see a list of location included in the project.

4. Filter each list by typing into the search/input box
